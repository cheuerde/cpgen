\title{Linear Mixed Models using Gibbs Sampling}

\description{
This function runs linear mixed models of the following form:
\deqn{
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Xb} + \mathbf{Z}_{1}\mathbf{u}_1 + \mathbf{Z}_{2}\mathbf{u}_2 + \mathbf{Z}_{3}\mathbf{u}_3 + ... + \mathbf{Z}_{k}\mathbf{u}_k + \mathbf{e}
}
The function allows to include an arbitrary number of independent random effects with each of them being assumed to follow: \eqn{MVN(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}\sigma^2_{u_k})}. If the covariance structure of one random effect is assumed to follow some \eqn{\mathbf{G}} then it it necessary to construct the design matrix for
that random effect as described in Waldmann et al. (2008): \eqn{\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{ZG}^{1/2}}.


}


\usage{
clmm(y, X = NULL , random = NULL, par_random = NULL, niter=10000, 
burnin=5000,scale_e=0,df_e=-2, verbose = TRUE, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{vector of phenotypes}
\item{X}{Fixed effects design matrix of type: \code{matrix} or \code{dgCMatrix}. If omitted a column-vector of ones will be assigned }
\item{random}{list of design matrices for random effects - every element of the list represents one random effect and may be of type: \code{matrix} or \code{dgCMatrix}}
\item{par_random}{list of options for random effects. If passed, the list must have as many elements as \code{random}. Every element must be a list of 3:
\itemize{
\item{scale - scale parameter for the inverse chi-square prior}
\item{df - degrees of freedom for the inverse chi-square prior}
\item{method - method to be used for the random effects, may be: \code{random} or \code{BayesA}}
}
}
\item{niter}{number of iterations}
\item{burnin}{number of iterations to be discarded as burnin}
\item{verbose}{prints progress to the screen}
\item{scale_e}{scale parameter for the inverse chi-square prior for the residuals}
\item{df_e}{degrees of freedom for the inverse chi-square prior for the residuals}
\item{seed}{seed for the random number generator. If omitted, a seed will be generated based on machine and time}
}



\details{
At this point the function allows to specify the method for any random term as: 'random' or 'BayesA'. 'random' assumes a common variance for all levels of the 
random effect, 'BayesA' assumes every level of the random effect to have its own distribution and variance as described in Meuwissen et al. (2001).
A wider range of methods is available in the excellent BGLR-package, which also allows phenotypes to be discrete (de los Campos et al. 2013). 

The focus of this function is to allow solving high-dimensional problems that are mixtures of sparse and dense features in the design matrices.
The computational expensive parts of the Gibbs Sampler are parallelized as described in Fernando et al. (2014).
Note that the parallel performance highly depends on the number of observations and features present in the design matrices. 
It is highly recommended to set the number of threads for less than 10000 observations (length of phenotype vector) to 1 using: \code{set_num_threads(1)} before
running a model. Even for larger sample sizes the parallel performance still depends on the dimension of the feature matrices.
Good results in terms of parallel scaling were observed starting from 50000 observations and more than 10000 features (i.e. number of markers).
Single threaded performance is very good thanks to smart computations during gibbs sampling (Fernando, 2013 (personal communication), de los Campos et al., 2009) 
and the use of efficient Eigen-methods for dense and sparse algebra.

of the Gibbs Sampler. Essential parts were adopted from the BayesC-implementation of Rohan Fernando and the BLR-package of Gustavo de los Campos.
The idea of how to parallelize the single site Gibbs Sampler came from Rohan Fernando (2013).
